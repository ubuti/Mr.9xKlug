# Mr.9xKlug


Still to do:

- Enable classification model with accuracy >0.95% for binary and >= 0.9 for multiple classes. 
    - Run arbitrary many different models. 
- Create validation set for automized evaluation.
- Seperate functionality into training/testing, evaluation, dataset generation. Ascertain for right type classification.
- Implement interactive display with gradio. Leave space for new model upload and testing (0 shot).
